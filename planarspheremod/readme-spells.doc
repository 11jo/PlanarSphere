Spell Name: Wave of Obliteration
Spell Desc: Wave of Obliteration:
Invocation
Level: 9
Range: 30ft 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 8 
This is a amazing find and for the adventuring mage and one of extreme use. The wave of obliteration spell was last seen being used around 100 years ago. Two nobles of Tethry were fighting over their fathers castle as his will had left its ownership in debate. As so often is the case in contentious circumstances the two nobles were both powerful archmages both having been tutored by their father in the art. This spell was apparently a family heir lomb and a source of great jealousy from other magical households. Needless to say the two nobles desided that the only answer was for a duel. The results were unpleasant to say the least, afterwards it was deduced from the rubble that both magi had released this spell simultaneously, the effects indeed show the power of this spell. One half of the castle was discovered several years later in  pond several miles away although the servants were never found....the mages were both buried in very small coffins. 
When the mage completes his incantation of this spell he raises his hands and pushes his palms away from himself. From his hands  a wall of pure uncontrolled magical energy bursts, The magic explodes forth taking every thing in its path with it. Any creature caught within this energy wave will take massive damage from the energies involved and must save versus spell or be literally obliterated by the sheer power of this spell.
Effects:
All creatures in the path of the spell will take 10d5+20 points of magical damage with no save. They must then save versus spell at -2 or be vapourised by the spell 


11SPpsq14.spl-
Spell Name: Sphere of Dissipation
Spell Desc: Sphere of Dissipation
Level 8
Abjuration
Casting Time: 9
Duration: 15 rounds 
This immensly powerful spell is shrouded in mystery (proably because only 4 copies of it have ever been discovered). Its abilities are truely immpressive making it possibly the most powerful protective spell availble to the mage however no one knows where the spell originated from, although some sages believe it was created in the days of Myth Drannor. When the final word of the spell is spoken a globe of twisting magical energies springs up around the caster. The magical globe absorbs all energy that strikes it dissipating it into nothingness. The energy that can be absorbed can be either physical or magical in origin and is completly nullified by the sphere. The intensity of energy that the sphere can absorb relies soley on the ability of the mage who cast the spell and as the mage increases in power so does the spell. 
At 16th level the spell protects from 1st to 3rd level spells and protects from non magical weapons.    
At 18th level the sphere protects from 1st to 4th level spells and still protects from normal weapons but grants 25% resistance to all physical attacks.
At 20th level the sphere protects from 1st to 5th level spells and grants immunity to normal and +1 weapons
At 25th level the sphere protects from 1st to 6th level spells, gives immunity to normal and +1 weapons and gives 25% resistance to all physical attacks.
At 30th level the sphere protects from 1st to 7th level spells and gives immunity to normal, +1 and +2 weapons.
The sphere cannot be used in conjuction with other weapon immunity spells.

Level 2
Casting Time:5/4
Range: 100ft
Evocation
Many a powerful mage has looked down their nose at this spell when they were but magelings only to stare in terror as it flew towards them later in life.

Level: 7
Range: Visual range of caster 
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 7 
Area of Effect: 30-foot radius x3  
Saving Throw: 1/2 

A fireball is an explosive burst of flame, which detonates with a low roar and delivers damage proportional to the level of the wizard who cast it - 1d6 points of damage for each level of experience of the spellcaster (up to a maximum of 10d6). The wizard points his finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball (an early impact results in an early detonation). Creatures failing their saving throws each suffer full damage from the blast. Those who roll successful saving throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, each receiving half. This is a more powerful version of the fireball spell, when the final word of the invocation is uttered three roaring balls of flame fly forth to strike 3 respective targets.

Spell Name: Infernal Combustion Enigma
Spell Desc: Infernal Combustion Enigma
Level: 7
Range: Visual range of caster 
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 30-foot radius 

The Infernal Combustion Enigma is a truely devastating spell although where it gets is power  remains a enigma. When cast a sphere of magical fire explodes forth from the mages hand and rushes towards his desired target. When the ball of magic strikes the target it explodes. When it  explodes a huge wall of magical flame erupts around the target, the very air is turned into searing flames and almost nothing is capable of withstanding the intensity of the resulting heat. Mages should be careful when using this spell as it can desimate both party and oppostion.
Effects:
The wall of flame does 10d5 of fire damage to all within the area of effect. It then deals a further 10d2 of magic damage although this can be negated if the target saves versus spell at -1.

Spell Name: Soul Cage
Spell Desc: Soul Cage
(Necromancy)
Level: 8
Casting Time: 1 turn
Target:One

A terrible spell to call upon indeed, this spell is considered so horrible that many magical societies have out lawed it ( the research into this spell is believed to be one reason the red wizards of thay split from the haluraans). When completed the soul of the target is surrounded by a cage of crackling energy that slowly shrinks pulling the soul of the victim into another plane where it is destroyed ( prehaps an anti-matter plane, or the negative energy plane). The death is exceeding horrible as the soul is literally torn free from the body, destroying both body and soul in the process. The victim is allowed a save a -4 to avoid having their soul destroyed even if they save versus the spell they still take 
10-20 damage and will be nauseated for a short time.

Spell Name: Karsus's Crimson Falmes
Spell Desc: Karsus's Crimson Falmes 
Range: Visual Range 
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 8 
Area of Effect: One Creature 
Saving Throw: None 

Karsus prehaps the most powerful of archmages to come to power in ancient nethril, and one of the most foolish for he attempted to sieze godhood through his magic and failed being punished with an eternity of torment. Karsus's spells are renowned for their power and this is no exception, being one of his most potent death magics.
When cast the target is surrounded by a aura of magical crimson falmes that literally burn the life of the target away. The falmes last for 4 rounds and each round the target must save at -1 or be instantly killed ( each round a diiferent save is used death,spell,breath etc).  Even if the target resists the death magic they are overcome with fear at being surrounded with the flames and will run in fear till the falmes extinguish. While a target is surrounded by the flames their regeneration (if any) will cease and they will be immune to all healing magics.

Spell Name:  Nagaths Polarised Pyrotechnics
Spell Desc: Nagaths Planar Pyrotechnics
Level: 9
Range: Visual range of caster 
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 3 rounds
Area of Effect: Huge!
Saving Throw: 1/2 

This is the final spell of the arch lich Nagath. He spent many hundreds of years journeying the multiverse, on his final trip it is believed that he crossed paths with an over god (much like lord Ao) on the astral plane, needless to say the proud archlich challenged the over god. The  arch lich could not have won but as the god banished him to a plane of eternal fire the archlich screamed forth this terrible spell. The god was unharmed but a shock wave of tectonic violence ran through the astral plane killing many of its inhabitants. When invoked this spell conjuers material from upward of 10 different planes spewing forth a maelstrom of incredible volence.  The main power  of this spell lies in that it draws its energy from its targets and the more beings the greater the power of the spell and the greater its area of effect. For each being the area of effect 2d10 of damage is done with no save and 1d10 damage is done although this can be avoided with a save vs spells at -2. So fantastic is the is the sheer power of the spell that all in side the area of effect (if they survive) will be confused for the next 5 rounds.

Spell Name: Thunder Bolt 
Spell Desc: Thunder Bolt (Evocation) 
Level: 8
Range: 150 yards
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: none

In some circles of Archmages it is considered rather pathetic to cast a lightning bolt like a weak little mage. So the thunder bolt was developed. while looking to all intensive purposes like a lightning bolt it is however charged a great deal more and capable of doing vast amounts of damage to anything it stikes. Like the lightning bolt the thunder bolt can rebound hence its mass destructive capabilites may also affect the party but there is no doubt an archmage with this spell can level nearly anything that opposes him.
Effects: 
The thunder bolt shoots forth and deals 10d8 electrical damage to the target although a save can be made versus spell at -2 to only receive 3/4 of the damage. So power is the Thunder bolt that it is also capable of blowing a enemy off their feet and knocking them unconcious.

Range: Visual sight of caster 
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: None

Prehaps the most unpleasant or prehaps the most satisfying word of power is the power word of burning. Apparently created by a pyromanical mage in the planar city of sigil called ignus.  When uttered the mage points his finger at the target, it is that targets unlucky day for this spell is immensly powerful. As the spell takes hold reality around the target ripples and changes opening a direct portal to the elemental plane of fire. So powerful is this spell that for a instant the target really is on the elemental plane of fire and unless they are resistant to fire or from the elemental of fire there is a good chance they will be vapourised into a cloud of ash by the heat this spell creates.
Effects:
Target will instantly take 40 points of fire damage with no save. They must then make a save versus death at 
-2 or be vapourised instantly by the heat from the elemental plane of fire.

Spell Name: Abyssal Fury
Spell Desc: Abyssal Fury
Range: 50 feet
Duration: Instant
Speed: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: see below

When compared to the Tanar'ri, at least the Baatezu are more civilized. There is, perhaps, nothing more horrific than the unbounded fury of Abyss. By use of this spell, the ground shall split open and the victim dragged into the Tanar'rian Madness. Welcome to Hell.

This spell opens a planar portal beneath a specified victim and drags them down into the Abyss. The portal remains open even after the victim is swallowed in. The only sound bystanders hear is the incessant screaming of the victim as he/she is torn apart by the ruthless Tanar'ri. After what seems like only a few seconds (which is more than an eternity for the victim in the Abyss), the victim (or what's left of him) gets spat back out of the portal. 
(1) If the victim makes a successful saving throw, he will get spat out of the portal in 'one piece,' but while the victim sensed nothing at first, after a split-second, all the Wrath of the Tanar'ri will surface. The victim will suffer 10d8 pts. of damage as he suffers multiple 'delayed' attacks and slashes from all angles. 
(2) If the victim fails the saving throw, it is instant death. All that is left are body parts.

Ajundurar's Ice Shard, a extremely useful spell often employed by powerful mages due to its comparitively short casting time. When the mage completes the incantation his hand bursts briefly into cold blue light and then a magical shard of freezing ice flies toward the target, inflicting cold damage upon them.

Effects:

The shard of ice inflicts 4d6 of cold damage on the target with no save plus 1d6 of cold damage where a save versus spells is allowed.

Duration: 30 rounds
Casting Time: 15
Area of Effect: Target creature
Saving Throw: None

Azuth the lord of spells, was once a powerful mortal archmage until he assended unto godhood. Shortly before he became a god it is believed he forged this spell, prehaps his crowning acheivement, even more so then imortality. However soon after his acension this spell was apparently destroyed by Mystra, for its power was to be feared even by the gods. This spell takes a mage a great deal of time to cast, however when it is finally unleased nothing may withstand it. For a single instant it surrounds the target with total nothingness, this nothingness drains magic from the target, severely weakening them. It is prehaps the only way a mage can battle a god for only a spell such as this can make a god vunerable to a mages magic.

Effects:

This spell wipes away magical resistances when cast all of the targets resistances will be lowered by 100% all physical and magical protections surronding the caster will also be removed as well as the targets immunity to magic. Any creature may be killed after being affected by this spell.

Spell Name: Tyndals Temporal Compressor
Spell Desc: Tyndals Temporal Compressor:
Level 7
Alteration
Duration: 1 Turn
Target:Self
Casting time: 8

A effective intra-combat spell for the adventuring mage. When cast reality is seen to warp and twist around the caster and he visibly fades out of existence. In actuality the caster is displaced slightly from the normal stream of time. The effect of this temporal displacement is to make the mage harder to affect from normal reality. Weapons seem not to be able to connect with the mage and any none magical weapon is incapale of affecting the mage. Because the mage no longer exists in the normal flow of events while under the effects of this spell no aging can take place, also speed altering spells and spells that imprision or maze  are useless against the mage. From the mages view the world appears to be moving exceedingly slowly but to others the mage moves extremely quickly becoming a deadly foe.

Effects:
Immunity to non-magical weapons.
40% resistance to all forms of physical attack.
+2 to all saving throws
+2 Armour class
Immunity to speed altering, imprisonment and maze spells.

A particular mage who long frequented the waterdeep region of the realms was a keen fan of magical dueling. In this dangerous sport magical items were bet and two mages would duel till one submitted, the winner taking the items. The mages name was Belfarst, he created a winning stratagee where by he would estimate his opponents ability and then count the number of spells they had cast so that he always had spells when his opponent was out. This method of dueling however failed him when he encountered Melectar. Melectar had long researched what powers allowed a mage to memorise spells. This enchantment was his result, it allowed him to rememorise spells after he had cast them. Although the casting was very difficult Melectar managed to cast it before the duel. Belfarst was horrified to discover that when he still had only a few magic missile spells left, Melectar was till tossing chain lightning. Melectar won, acidentally killing Belfarst with a disintergrate spell. This spell is his legacy to magic though its uses strech far beyond dueling. This spell rememorises one wizard spell of 6th level or lower every turn for the duration of spell. Due to the energies involved there is a small chance that the spell will cause 5d10 damage upon casting, the spell regeneration will still occur though.

Spell Desc: Blood to Acid
(Alteration) 
Level: 6
Range: 0
Duration: 20 rounds
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: The Caster 
Saving Throw: None 

When cast the mages blood bubbles and warps turning into a highly concentrated acid. Strangely enough this has no adverse effect on the caster. It does however prove a powerful deterant to attack. When a successful attack is made the casters blood sprays onto the attacker. The blood now being highly acidic burns and scars the attacker eating into their flesh. While also hurting the attackers the acid in the blood burns away all poisons that might effect the caster. 
Effects:
Every attack made against the caster does 2d8+3 acid damage to the attacker.
Immunity to Poison
100% resistance to acid.

Spell Name: Dance Macabre
Spell Desc: Dance Macabre
(Alteration)
Level: 9
Casting Time: 8
Range: Visual Range
Saving Throw: Neg

This spell is generally accompanied by a wave of evil laughter. Apparently this spell was created by a fairy godmother  (who as everyone knows are generally pretty strange people) gone mad. The kitchen maid  had of course just married the prince.  The fairy godmother was casting a spell to allow them to dance in mid air surrounded by music and magical lights. However during the casting, for absolutely no apparent reason the fairy godmother went completely and utterly insane. The spell reflected this sudden change of mental state and the bodies of the maid and prince withered into decayed corpses dancing for all eternity (funelly enough no one really seemed to mind since the marriage was only so the king could fufil a clause in a will allowing him to collect a vast inheritance). Never the less despite the stressful circumstances the court mage managed to copy down the spell as the fairy godmother screamed it. Luckily he had the forsight to copy it onto a fire proof scroll. This was luckily because several seconds later the fairy godmother turned herself into a small purple atomic pumpkin. Several years later when the castle ruins had ceased to glow mauve, an adventuring mage found the scroll and the spell has propigated from that time forth.  This spell causes the targets body to decay into rotting corpse that spasams and jerks as it dances to some obscene infernal music. The target can save versus death at -3 otherwise it will dance forever or until slain. Even if they resist the effect of spell they are still cursed with bad luck for 6 hours.

Stinking cloud, Cloudkill, Death fog, Incendary Cloud and Miasma.

(Summoning)
Level: 8
Casting Time : 12
Range: Caster
Saving Throw: Neg.

Tereledra was a powerful archmage who resided on the plane of dust, a plane that sucks the life out of its inhabitants. Tereledra had long travelled the planes and had built up many enemies especially in the anarchist faction of sigil. After being attacked by a group of anarchist wild mages he decided to give it all up, change his name and vanish. For many years he journeyed the inner planes free of his old foes. He joined with a well respected group of mercenaries and travelled with them long, eventually he confieded in them his old and secret identity, feeling he could trust them. Little had he bargined on the size of the anarcists reward for his head. The mercenary group turned on him. They underestimated his power and Tereledra in a fit of rage slew them all consigning their souls to a pocket plane to serve him for all eternity. This spell their only gateway to the rest of the planes. It is believed that Tereledra was later slain when one of the wraith company was resurected by a simpathetic priest, the freed wraith killed Tereledra in a single stroke.  This spell will call forth 5 to 10 wraiths of Tereledra's old mercenary group. The wraiths will serve the caster for 2 hours before returning to their pocket plane. The wraiths are fighters of between 7th and 10th level carrying +1 equipment. The wraiths will serve the caster without question but cannot communicate with anything else. The wraiths will also serve Tereledra before any other so they are incapable of fighting him or in any way inconviniencing him.
